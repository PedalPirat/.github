# Project Overview
PedalPirat is an ambitious **Open Source Bike Platform** that aims to create the ultimate smart bike by integrating multiple wireless protocols including ANT+, CAN, Bluetooth, and Power Delivery technologies.

## Core Mission
The project seeks to revolutionize cycling technology by creating a vendor-independent, open-source platform that enhances bike functionality, safety, and user experience.

## Project Goals
The PedalPirat project pursues several innovative objectives:

1. **Power Management**: Replace proprietary batteries with a central powerbank that can be charged by a hub dynamo
2. **Interoperability**: Enable vendor-independent component integration (e.g., Shimano levers with SRAM AXS)
3. **Enhanced Security**: Implement light control, radars, and AI-powered cameras for rider safety
4. **E-Bike Integration**: Bring e-bike technology to traditional bikes (e.g., Rohloff E-14)
5. **Smart Automation**: Automated shifting and reporting of cars parked in bike paths
6. **Fun Features**: Including heated handlebar tape
7. **Data Management**: Comprehensive data fusion and logging capabilities

## Innovation Highlights

1. **Vendor Independence**: Breaking down proprietary barriers in bike component ecosystems
2. **AI Integration**: Using machine learning for safety features like detecting parked cars on bike paths
3. **Unified Power System**: Centralized power management for all bike electronics
4. **Multi-Protocol Support**: Seamless integration of ANT+, CAN, Bluetooth, and LIN protocols
5. **Open Source Approach**: Making advanced bike technology accessible to everyone

## Project Status
The project is in **active planning and documentation phase**, with comprehensive hardware specifications defined and integration pathways documented. The focus has been on creating a solid foundation for implementation with clear documentation of all components and their interactions.
